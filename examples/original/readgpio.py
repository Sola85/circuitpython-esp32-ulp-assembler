Example for: ESP32

Very basic example showing how to read a GPIO pin from the ULP and access
that data from the main CPU.

In this case GPIO4 is being read. Note that the ULP needs to refer to GPIOs
via their RTC channel number. You can see the mapping in this file:
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/v5.0.2/components/soc/esp32/include/soc/rtc_io_channel.h#L51

If you change to a different GPIO number, make sure to modify both the channel
number and also the RTC_IO_TOUCH_PAD0_* references appropriately. The best place
to see the mappings might be this table here (notice the "real GPIO numbers" as
comments to each line):
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/v5.0.2/components/soc/esp32/rtc_io_periph.c#L53

The timer is set to a rather long period, so you can watch the data value
change as you change the GPIO input (see loop at the end).
